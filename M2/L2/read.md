  { name: "Mince Flies", price: 19.0, onSpecial: true },
];
```

### Question 4

  },
  {
    firstName: "Elvis",
    lastName: "Deadly",
    age: 55,

  {
    firstName: "Susan",
    lastName: "Sarongson",
    age: 42,
  },
  {
    firstName: "Big",
    lastName: "Gabe",
    age: 20,
  },
];
```

### Question 5

Select the `ul` element in the HTML file, loop through the array below and create a `li` element containing the product name and price properties.

```js
var products = [
  {
    name: "Elephant eggs",
    price: 45.0,
  },
  {
    name: "Bucket of water",
    price: 459.99,
  },
  {
    name: "4 cabbages",
    price: 500.95,
  },
];
```

Your final HTML should look like this:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Elephant eggs - 45.00</li>
  <li>Bucket of water - 459.99</li>
  <li>4 cabbages - 500.95</li>
</ul>
```
